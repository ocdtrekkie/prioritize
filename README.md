This is a trivial [sandstorm][1] app that I use to keep track of
periodic tasks which have some flexibility. Lots of cleaning tasks,
but also things like getting some exercise.

You add tasks with a "period" in days. The app then lists tasks sorted
by how overdue they are, and you can mark them as "done," at which point
they are removed from the list until their period has elapsed again.

This works better for me for some tasks than apps where tasks have fixed
deadlines.

The app is incredibly bare-bones, and not on the app market yet; I might
publish it when it's less spartan, but right now it is barely an MVP for
even my own use.
